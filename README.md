# System-Dysfunc
1st created Repo
"System Dysfunctional", "System-Dysfunc", "System Dysfunc" copywrited property of Engco Business Solutions.
Hi, I am Crowder Songs, owner of Engco Business and currently I am in the process of learning to code.
  - Quite literally a Freshman in a Computer Science program at CTU and always looking for new and fresh projects. 
    - This Repo serves as a starting point on Github. My system has many moving parts and has been scrapped only once so far. 
    - With some luck, I will be able to finish this project in a couple months. 
  
  - The Project consists of 3 phases. This is Phase 1. Phase 2 has been underway for several months. That is how the name System-Dysfunc
  comes into play. I mean who starts phase 2 before phase one? I need a Spoon... Any good Merchant Bots I can spoon with?
